# Chess Logic Microservice

A real-time chess game engine microservice built with Spring Boot, providing WebSocket-based gameplay, gRPC APIs for room management, and Redis for persistent game state storage.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Project Status**: This is a work-in-progress microservice. Many features are still under development and the codebase is actively being improved. Use at your own discretion.

## üéØ Overview

This microservice handles the core chess game logic, room management, and real-time communication for a distributed chess application. It validates moves using the chesslib library, manages game states, and provides both WebSocket and gRPC interfaces for different client interactions.

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-time Chess Gameplay**: WebSocket-based move handling with live game updates
- **Room Management**: Create and join chess rooms with player matching
- **Chess Engine Integration**: Full chess rule validation using chesslib library
- **Game State Persistence**: Redis-based storage for game continuity
- **Timer Support**: Built-in chess clocks with customizable time controls
- **Multiple Game Formats**: Support for Blitz, Bullet, Classical, and Rapid games
- **Draw Management**: Offer/accept draw functionality
- **Authentication**: JWT-based security integration
- **gRPC API**: High-performance room operations
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full game scenario coverage

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Core Framework
- **Spring Boot 3.x** - Main application framework
- **Spring WebSocket** - Real-time communication
- **Spring Security** - Authentication and authorization
- **Spring Data JPA** - Database operations (PostgreSQL integration)

### Chess Engine
- **chesslib** - Chess move validation and game logic

### Communication
- **gRPC** - High-performance room management APIs
- **Protocol Buffers** - Service definitions
- **WebSocket** - Real-time game communication

### Data Storage
- **Redis** - Game state persistence and caching
- **Jedis** - Redis Java client
- **PostgreSQL** - Relational database (configured but not actively used in game logic)

### Security & Utils
- **JWT (jsonwebtoken)** - Token-based authentication
- **Jackson** - JSON processing
- **Lombok** - Code generation
- **Log4j2** - Logging

### Testing
- **JUnit 5** - Unit and integration testing
- **Spring Boot Test** - Test framework integration

## üì° API Endpoints

### WebSocket Endpoints
```
WS /api/ws/game/{roomId} - Real-time game communication
```

**Message Types:**
- `MOVE` - Execute chess moves
- `RESIGN` - Resign from game
- `DRAW` - Offer/accept draws
- `UPDATE` - Get current game state

### gRPC Services
```proto
service RoomService {
  rpc CreateRoom(CreateRoomRequest) returns (RoomResponse);
  rpc JoinRoom(JoinRoomRequest) returns (RoomResponse);
}
```

**Ports:**
- HTTP Server: `8081`
- gRPC Server: `4967`

## üéÆ Game Flow

1. **Room Creation**: Create a chess room via gRPC with player assignments
2. **Room Joining**: Second player joins the room
3. **WebSocket Connection**: Players connect to the game room
4. **Real-time Gameplay**: Moves are validated and broadcast to all players
5. **Game Completion**: Handle checkmate, stalemate, draws, or resignations

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Key Components

- **ChessService**: Core game logic and room management
- **ChessWebSocketHandler**: Real-time communication handler
- **MessageRouter**: WebSocket message routing and processing
- **RedisService**: Game state persistence layer
- **RoomGrpcController**: gRPC API endpoints
- **JwtFilter**: Authentication middleware

### Design Patterns
- **Builder Pattern**: RoomState construction
- **Strategy Pattern**: Message type handling
- **Repository Pattern**: Redis data access

## ü§ù Integration

This microservice is designed to work with:
- **User Management Service** (JWT token validation)
- **Game History Service** (completed game storage)
- **Matchmaking Service** (Calculating rating and making games)
- **Frontend Applications** (Web/Mobile clients)
